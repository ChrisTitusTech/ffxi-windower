        Filters are customizable based on the action user. So if you filter other pets, you're going
        to eliminate all messages initiated by everyone's pet but your own.
        True means "filter this"
        False means "don't filter this"
        
        Generally, the outer tag is the actor and the inner tag is the action.
        If the monster is the actor, then the inner tag is the target and the tag beyond that is the action.

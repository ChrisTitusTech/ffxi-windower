============== Advanced "sets" tables ==============

-- Augments --
There are a lot of different augments, many/all of which have been mapped in the extdata library.
This system will use the first item it finds in your inventory that matches the name/augment
combination that you provide. If you provide an ambiguous set of conditions, the resulting equipped
item will be ambiguous (could vary based on the pairs iterator).

In order to specify an item by augment, you must write the augment exactly as it appears on your equipment:
    sets.aftercast_Idle = {ring1={name="Dark Ring",augments={"Phys. Damage Taken -6%"}},
	    ring2={name="Dark Ring",augments={"Breath Damage Taken -6%","{Phys. Damage Taken -5%"}}}

		
If it pleases you, you can store your augmented items in variables:
    lefty = {name="Dark Ring",augments={"Phys. Damage Taken -6%"}}
	righty = {name="Dark Ring",augments={"Breath Damage Taken -6%","Phys. Damage Taken -5%"}}
	sets.aftercast_Idle = {ring1=lefty,ring2=righty}

This will save you a little work when you are dealing with using the same augmented item in multiple sets.


If you are having trouble getting GearSwap to recognize your augment, equip the gear and use //gs export.
This will create a Lua file in ../windower/addons/gearswap/data/export that includes a properly formatted table.




-- Prioritizing gear changes --
Currently equip swaps can be ordered by using advanced "sets" tables similar to the above:
    sets.nohead = {head={name="empty",priority=1},lring={name="Angha ring",priority=2}}

Gear is changed in descending order from highest to lowest, so the above set would equip Angha ring and then
unequip the head slot. All gear that is not defined is given a default priority of zero, and all positive and
negative rational numbers are acceptable priorities. If two pieces of gear have the same priority value, they
will be swapped in the default order (from 0 to 15 in ../windower/res/slots.lua).

I do not recommend moving Sub in front of Main, Ammo in front of Range, etc. as these will cause silent equip
failures.



-- Specifying a bag --
With the introduction of Mog Wardrobe, it is now possible to equip items from either Inventory or Wardrobe:
    sets.wardrobe_feet = {feet={name="Bokwus Boots",bag="wardrobe"}}

There is really no reason to do this 99% of the time, but it has been included as a failsafe to let people
still specify at least two augments in case the augment system stops working in the future.

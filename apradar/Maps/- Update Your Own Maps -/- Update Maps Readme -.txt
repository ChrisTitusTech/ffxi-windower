Using the included batch files, you can now easily rename and update your own maps, 
then change the names back for use with FFAssist2/Mapmon whenever you want.  
Just make certain that you save them as 512x512 gif files.
ENSURE ALL GIFS ARE RENAMED FOR FFASSIST/MAPMON OR THE MAPS WILL NOT WORK.

MAP.INI LINE GENERATOR.HMTL
- I take no credit for creating this; I adapted it from a submission in the JP forums
- only works with Internet Explorer
- generates map.ini lines;  use with extreme caution though, the 3D and 2D reference coordinates must be exact or the line will be innaccurate
- PLEASE confirm your line works by testing it in game before posting it online . . . 

FIND 3D COORDINATES.HTML
- I take no credit for creating this; I adapted it from a submission in the JP forums
- only works with Internet Explorer

- PLEASE test these 3D coordinates in-game before using them to define map areas . . .
